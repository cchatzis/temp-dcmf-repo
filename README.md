Installation steps
------------------

This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 11 using python 3.10.12.

For Linux/Mac:
`$  ./setup.sh`

For Windows:
execute `setup.bat`

This will create a virtual environment, install the required packages, and launch the Jupyter Notebook. You can install venv for python3.10 with:
```
apt install python3.10-venv
```

The implementation is based on matcouply (https://matcouply.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and tlviz (https://tensorly.org/viz/stable/).
